# 02180_Belief_Revision_Agent
A repository for the implementation of a belief revision agent in 02180 Introduction to AI

In this repository you will find an implementation of a belief revision agent written in python.
Belief revision is a concept in which logical sentences are structured in belief bases where their logical relations are maintained or updated according to new sentences/beliefs. The most well known paradigm in the field is the AGM framework, which is the one that has been implemented in this project.

## **/tests**
This subfolder holds the test cases to show the validity of the implementation as well as testing key aspects and functionalities.

### **AGM.py**
In this file the 5 AGM postulates: Success, Inclusion, Vacuity, Consistency and Extensionality, are proven for the implemntation.

### **Sunflower.py**
This test implements the flower variation of the mastermind game from the exercise session of week 10 in the course.

### **test_cases.py**
These test cases are made to show how the belief base are translated into CNF.
The CNF form is neccesary to execute the DPLL algorithm.
